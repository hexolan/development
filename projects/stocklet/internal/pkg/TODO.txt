make folders less verbose

find a better grouping of functionality
or implement sub grouping to reduce visual mess
such as
> pkg/standard (or just std.)
    > ./config
    > ./errors
    > ./logging
> pkg/providers (or some other more suitable word) (e.g. clients)
    > ./storage
    > ./messaging
    > (maybe) ./caching
> pkg/utils (or something or other)
    > ./serve (or serveutil)

    todo: find area to implement common gateway and RPC functions
    related to authentication and decoding base64 token.

potentially implement the interface without the sub folders and just:

pkg/std-config
pkg/std-errors
pkg/std-logging
pkg/prov-storage
pkg/prov-messaging
pkg/prov-caching
pkg/util-serve

todo: look at best practices to see how other libraries/projects typically handle this.#

for now continue development, but some spring-cleaning will be needed to tidy this up before completion
