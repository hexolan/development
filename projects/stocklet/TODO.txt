[*] fix and improve protobuf schemas
    > https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/dos-donts/
    > common protobuf types such as address

[*] separate structs for database objects
    > convert from db struct to protobuf format
    > converting from protobuf to db object | then storing with that db object

[*] separation of update methods. e.g. UpdateOrder
    > UpdateOrder
        > calls individual update methods? (also makes validation simpler)

        > UpdateOrderAddress (example, maybe something else updatable)
        > UpdateOrderStatus
            * dispatches its own OrderStatusEvent in 'order.state.status'

[*] stop worrying about gRPC-gateway until after
