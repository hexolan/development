# Stocklet: Docs

## Table of Contents

* [Events](/docs/EVENTS.md)
* [Feature Roadmap](/docs/ROADMAP.md)

## Formatting, styling, etc

The code has been formatted using [`gofmt`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt).

The protobuf schema files have been formatted using [`buf format`](https://buf.build/docs/reference/cli/buf/format).

The markdown files have been linted and formatted using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint).

I used [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) as the tool to help make the diagrams in the documentation. The PlantUML files are avaliable alongside the resulting images: [`/docs/imgs/overview.plantuml`](/docs/imgs/overview.plantuml) and [`/docs/imgs/placeordersaga.plantuml`](/docs/imgs/placeordersaga.plantuml)
