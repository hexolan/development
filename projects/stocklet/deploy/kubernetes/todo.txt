Skaffold for building containers
that to Helm charts for deployment stage

TODO:
- turn manifests into Helm charts
- make manifests more Kubernetes native (no Docker network references etc)
- ensure functionality of Skaffold build flow
- setup for Istio (see if I can remove edge-gateway when using Istio w/ Kubernetes)
- passing environment configs to the Kubernetes service deployments (../configs)
    - maybe also passing certs directly as secrets (which Kubernetes encodes with base64 by default IIRC)
