Add-Migration InitialCreate
(default project set to: Formulator.Infrastructure)
(from root dir of project in package manager console)

---

feature roadmap:
* quizes (auto answer and scoring - pending review for complex word answers)
* sending emails
* support for updating responses
* REST API layer (to allow for form admins to fetch form responses easily - maybe even websockets to recieve responses in real time?)
