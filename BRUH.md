# Project Ideas

* Decentralised Social Media Application - similiar to twitter
  * Text only - but maybe referencing images on the IPFS?
  * Application Clients - user can add labels to certain public keys (thereby ascertaining who has posted what)
  * Incentives for 'mining' - proof of stake/proof of work? - would maybe need to be built on top another blockchain such as eth
    * look at how the IPFS (interplanetary file system) manages this?
    * there are no incentives with the IPFS
