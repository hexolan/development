# Project Ideas

* Decentralised Social Media Application - similiar to twitter
  * Text only - but maybe referencing images on the IPFS?
  * Application Clients - user can add labels to certain public keys (thereby ascertaining who has posted what)
  * Incentives for 'mining' - proof of stake/proof of work? - would maybe need to be built on top another blockchain such as eth
    * there are no incentives with the IPFS (interplanetary file system)

* "My goto project is always a music player, it has networking, file management, byte stream management, all kind of data structures can be used for playlists, database access. Basically a simple to visualise project that covers everything."

Simple things such as a checkers/chess game
* use websockets, dealing with networking, making scalable
* can build frontend in Svelete/similar
* can build backend in anything (potentially try Java/C++)
